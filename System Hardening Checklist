System Hardening Checklist
This checklist provides a comprehensive guide to hardening systems (servers, workstations, and network devices) to minimize security risks and ensure compliance with industry standards like CIS, NIST, and OWASP. It is designed to be adaptable to Linux, Windows, and network environments, demonstrating a thorough approach to cybersecurity.

1. Initial Setup and Inventory

Document System Details: Record OS version, hardware specs, installed software, and network configurations.
Define System Role: Identify the system's purpose (e.g., web server, database, workstation) to tailor hardening measures.
Patch Management: Ensure the latest OS and software patches are applied (e.g., apt update && apt upgrade for Debian-based systems, yum update for RHEL-based, or Windows Update).
Backup Critical Data: Create and verify backups of configurations and critical data before making changes.


2. User and Access Control

Enforce Least Privilege:
Remove or disable unnecessary user accounts.
Assign users only the permissions required for their role.


Strong Password Policies:
Enforce complex passwords (minimum 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols).
Configure password aging (e.g., 90-day expiration).
For Linux: Edit /etc/login.defs or use pam_pwquality.
For Windows: Use Group Policy (secpol.msc) to set password policies.


Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
Enable MFA for all privileged accounts (e.g., SSH with Google Authenticator on Linux, Windows Hello, or third-party MFA solutions).


Disable Root/Administrator Login:
Linux: Disable root SSH access (PermitRootLogin no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config).
Windows: Rename and disable the default Administrator account.


Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Implement RBAC for applications and services (e.g., Active Directory for Windows, sudo configurations for Linux).




3. Network Security

Minimize Open Ports:
Use netstat, ss, or nmap to identify open ports.
Close unnecessary ports and services (e.g., systemctl disable <service>).


Configure Firewall:
Linux: Use ufw or iptables to allow only required traffic (e.g., ufw allow 22/tcp for SSH).
Windows: Configure Windows Firewall to block inbound connections by default.
Network Devices: Set ACLs to restrict traffic.


Enable Encrypted Protocols:
Use SSH, TLS, or IPsec for all remote access and data transfers.
Disable insecure protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, HTTP).


Implement Network Segmentation:
Use VLANs or subnets to isolate critical systems.
Restrict inter-system communication with firewall rules.


Monitor Network Traffic:
Deploy IDS/IPS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) to detect and block suspicious activity.




4. System Configuration

Secure Boot Process:
Enable Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized OS loading.
Protect BIOS/UEFI with a strong password.


Disable Unnecessary Services:
Linux: Use systemctl list-units --type=service to review and disable unneeded services.
Windows: Use services.msc to stop and disable non-essential services (e.g., Print Spooler if unused).


Harden Kernel Parameters:
Linux: Configure /etc/sysctl.conf (e.g., disable IP forwarding: net.ipv4.ip_forward=0).
Windows: Apply security templates via Group Policy.


File System Security:
Set strict permissions (e.g., chmod 750 for sensitive directories, chown to appropriate users).
Use immutable flags on critical files (Linux: chattr +i).
Enable NTFS permissions and EFS for sensitive Windows files.


Enable Disk Encryption:
Linux: Use LUKS for full-disk encryption.
Windows: Enable BitLocker for drives.




5. Application and Service Hardening

Secure Web Servers:
Apache/Nginx: Disable directory listing, enable TLS 1.2/1.3, and use secure ciphers.
IIS: Disable unnecessary modules, enforce HTTPS, and restrict anonymous access.


Database Security:
Use strong credentials and encrypt connections (e.g., MySQL: require_secure_transport=ON).
Restrict database access to specific IPs.


Application Whitelisting:
Linux: Use AppArmor or SELinux to restrict application behavior.
Windows: Implement AppLocker to allow only approved applications.


Secure Email Services:
Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for email servers.
Enable STARTTLS for SMTP.




6. Logging and Monitoring

Enable Centralized Logging:
Linux: Configure rsyslog or syslog-ng to send logs to a SIEM (e.g., ELK Stack).
Windows: Enable Event Logging and forward to a SIEM.


Audit Critical Actions:
Linux: Use auditd to monitor file access and system calls.
Windows: Enable auditing in Group Policy (Audit Object Access, Audit Logon Events).


Monitor Logs for Anomalies:
Set up alerts for failed login attempts, privilege escalations, or unusual network activity.


Regular Log Review:
Schedule weekly reviews of logs to identify potential security incidents.




7. Patch and Vulnerability Management

Regular Patching:
Apply security patches within 30 days of release (or sooner for critical vulnerabilities).
Automate patching where possible (e.g., WSUS for Windows, unattended-upgrades for Ubuntu).


Vulnerability Scanning:
Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys to scan for vulnerabilities monthly.
Remediate high-severity vulnerabilities within 7 days.


Remove Unsupported Software:
Uninstall end-of-life software (e.g., Python 2.x, Windows Server 2012).




8. Backup and Recovery

Regular Backups:
Schedule automated backups of critical data and configurations.
Store backups offline or in a secure, encrypted location.


Test Restores:
Perform quarterly restore tests to ensure data integrity.


Secure Backup Access:
Restrict backup access to authorized personnel with MFA.




9. Compliance and Documentation

Align with Standards:
Follow CIS Benchmarks, NIST 800-53, or ISO 27001 for system hardening.
Document deviations and justifications.


Maintain Configuration Records:
Keep an updated inventory of hardened configurations and changes.


Conduct Regular Audits:
Perform quarterly security audits to verify hardening measures.




10. Employee Training and Awareness

Security Training:
Train staff on secure system usage, phishing awareness, and password management.


Incident Response Plan:
Develop and test an incident response plan for security breaches.
Include contact lists, escalation procedures, and recovery steps.




Notes

Tailor to Environment: Adjust this checklist based on specific system roles, organizational policies, and compliance requirements.
Automation: Use tools like Ansible, Chef, or PowerShell DSC to automate hardening tasks.
Continuous Improvement: Regularly update the checklist based on emerging threats and new best practices.

This checklist demonstrates a proactive, systematic approach to system hardening, ensuring robust security across diverse environments.
